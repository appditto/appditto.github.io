<p>
This Blaise Mobile Application End User License Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is a binding agreement between you ("<strong>End User</strong>," "<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>") and <strong>Appditto LLC </strong>("<strong>Appditto</strong>",<strong> </strong>" <strong>we</strong>", <strong>"our</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>").
    This Agreement governs your use on your mobile device of the compiled,
    executable <strong>Blaise </strong>mobile application released by
us, and all related documentation (collectively, the "    <strong>Application</strong>").
</p>
<p>
    The Application is licensed (not sold) to you, pursuant to and subject to
    your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

    <strong><u>DISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ THIS FIRST</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    THE APPLICATION IS OWNED, OPERATED AND RELEASED BY APPDITTO LLC
    ONLY. APPDITTO LLC IS INDEPENDENT OF, AND OPERATES SEPARATELY FROM,
    THE ENTITIES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING, OPERATING, MAINTAINING OR SUPPORTING
    THE PASCALCOIN PROTOCOL, THE PASCALCOIN NETWORK, THE PASCALCOIN CURRENCY OR ANY
    SOFTWARE WALLET THAT IS NOT RELEASED BY APPDITTO LLC (COLLECTIVELY,
    "<strong>SEPARATE TECHNOLOGIES</strong>"). FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, APPDITTO LLC
     DOES NOT OWN, DEVELOP, OPERATE, MAINTAIN OR SUPPORT ANY OF
    THE SEPARATE TECHNOLOGIES.

<p>
    APPDITTO LLC IS NOT A BANK, CUSTODIAN OR OTHER FINANCIAL COMPANY AND
    DOES NOT PROVIDE BANKING, CUSTODIAL OR OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES. THE
    APPLICATION IS NOT A BANKING, CUSTODIAL OR OTHER SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE
    APPLICATION AND YOUR CREATION AND ACCESSING OF A WALLET ON THE PASCALCOIN
    NETWORK (A "<strong>WALLET</strong>") USING THE APPLICATION DOES
    NOT INVOLVE THE OPENING, ESTABLISHING OR MANAGING OF AN "ACCOUNT" WITH APPDITTO LLC; INSTEAD, YOU ARE SIMPLY USING THE APPLICATION TO INTERACT WITH THE PASCALCOIN NETWORK AND YOUR WALLET/ACCOUNTS ON
    THE PASCALCOIN NETWORK.
</p>
<p>
    A "<strong>WALLET PRIVATE KEY</strong>" IS A UNIQUE CODE THAT IS PROVIDED TO YOU
    BY THE APPLICATION, THROUGH ITS DIRECT INTERACTION WITH THE PASCALCOIN
    NETWORK (I.E., WITHOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT) WHEN YOU FIRST CREATE A NEW
    WALLET USING THE APPLICATION. YOUR WALLET PRIVATE KEY IS THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO
    RECOVER YOUR WALLET ON THE PASCALCOIN NETWORK AND ACCESS ANY PASCALCOIN
    CURRENCY YOU STORE IN THAT WALLET.
</p>
<p>
    WE DO NOT RECEIVE, COLLECT, RECORD, STORE OR HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR WALLET
    PRIVATE KEY. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT RECOVER IT FOR YOU IF YOU LOSE IT AND WE CANNOT
    PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCESS TO ANY PASCALCOIN CURRENCY THAT YOU STORE IN YOUR WALLET.
    YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR RECORDING YOUR WALLET PRIVATE KEY IN A SAFE AND
    SECURE PLACE AND MANNER. DO NOT SHARE YOUR WALLET PRIVATE KEY WITH ANYONE, OR
    PERMIT ANYONE TO USE YOUR MOBILE DEVICE ON WHICH THE APPLICATION IS
    INSTALLED WHO YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR WALLET OR YOUR PASCALCOIN
    CURRENCY.
</p>
<p>
    ANY PASCALCOIN CURRENCY THAT YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS, HOLD, STORE, MANAGE, RECEIVE,
    SEND OR TRANSMIT USING THE APPLICATION, AND ANY BALANCE AND TRANSACTION
    INFORMATION RELATING TO IT, ARE NEVER ACCESSED, HELD, STORED, MANAGED,
    RECEIVED, SENT OR TRANSMITTED BY APPDITTO LLC.
</p>

<p>
    YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, YOUR
    PASCALCOIN CURRENCY, AND YOUR WALLET PRIVATE KEY. APPDITTO LLC IS NOT AND WILL
    NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE SECURITY OR PROTECTION OF YOUR
    PASCALCOIN CURRENCY OR WALLET PRIVATE KEY.
</p>
<p>
    YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND APPDITTO LLC
    DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE
    SECURITY, COMPATIBILITY, SUITABILITY OR RELIABILITY OF THE APPLICATION OR
    ANY PASCALCOIN CURRENCY THAT YOU ACCESS, HOLD, STORE, MANAGE, RECEIVE, SEND OR
    TRANSMIT USING THE APPLICATION.
